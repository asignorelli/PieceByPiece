# Piece By Piece
Our project for HACKPSU

## Overview
You a robot, but scientists have disassembled you. You begin as a head with only the ability to roll around. If you wish to escape the lab, you have to pass challenges to collect other parts of your body. Once you collect new parts, you have new movement abilities unlocked. This allows you to pass harder levels and also to go to new areas in previous levels that were unreachable before. 

## How we built it
We used Godot and GDScript for the main logic of the game. We designed the levels fully and then began work on the GDScript for game logic. We also used GIMP to create our sprites.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran out of time when it came to actually coding the logic. We naively assumed that something as simple as pushing a crate would be easy to code, but we ran into so many errors just some being inexperienced that it ate into our time too much. When it is 5am and your character is still falling through the floor, you know it's not going to be finished on time.
It was also difficult to find a workflow balance for coworking in Godot. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the levels we designed (even if they cannot be shown off quite yet!) and we are proud of the sprites we made. The majority of sprites were free resources (actually costed a $1 we balled out) but our team created our main character from scratch and even have unused run animations for later.

## What we learned
We learned how to work in Godot piece by piece. We learned a lot of how to build levels but still struggling on how to code in Godot. 

## What's next for Piece by Piece
We definitely have plans to finish the game. We think when there is not a time constraint, we can give it the care and attention it deserved. We want to finish the game to follow the original plotline we envisioned.
